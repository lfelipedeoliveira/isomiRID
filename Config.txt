# Main Reference:
# Set the path to main reference (pre-miRNA p.e.)
# and IF it is needed to build the index
# for bowtie (bowtie-build)/("yes" or "no" )
# PS: The nucleotide sequences of pre-microRNA
# should be in the form of DNA (using T instead of U)

# Filter Reference:
# Set the reference that will be used as a filter on
# round 0 (e.g. Reference Genome or Transcriptome)
# IF it is needed to build the index
# for bowtie (bowtie-build)/
# set "yes" or "no" if not.

# Search for known miRNAs:
# Set path to fasta file with known microRNAs.
# This setting will create an additional output with

# Addition and Rounds:
# Set the addition analysis type to remove the last 3' and/or

# If you don't want to perform 3' or 5' addition analysis
# set a double "no" separate by a space

# Cutoff Size:
# Set the size range of reads that should be considered
# on this analysis (min and max).

# Cutoff abundance:
# Set the cutoff of read abundance (amount of reads that must be present in all libs)
# It is possible to apply more than one cutoffll
# This option will generate two or more final tables (one for each cutoff).
# If you don't want to use cutoff, set it as no:
